### Data folder

Since the processed data is too large that we can not upload them on Github,please refer to the [kaggle data page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/outbrain-click-prediction/data) for the original datasets we use. And you may get the processed data through the merge_data.R code in the lib file.( Notice: process the original data may take some time and has some require for PC memory, at least 8G memory is needed.)
