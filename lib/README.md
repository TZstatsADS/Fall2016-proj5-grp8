# Project: 
### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains three codes: 

1.First you may get the original data on the Kaggle( please see our data file) and then use the perge_data.R code to process the original data so that you may get the processed data. The merge_data.R code is mainly combining some csv files through key words.

2.After you get the processed data, you can use the calculate_probability.R to calculate the probability matrix of P(ad_feature|document_feature).

3.After get the probability matrix, you can apply them to the processed test data through the last R code and get the ranked csv file.
