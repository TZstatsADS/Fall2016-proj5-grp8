+ Project summary: In this project, we develop a system in predicting whether users will click on certain promoted advertisements on the browsing webpage. The idea comes from a [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/outbrain-click-prediction). The datasets of the browsing webpage cover its topic, category and publisher while those of the promoted advertisements cover its advertiser and related campaign.
